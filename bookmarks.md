## @kr0der - Codex Usage Tips
> if you're also trying out Codex like me, here are some important tips that made Codex way better for me:
>
> 1. i always run codex —yolo or else it keeps stopping to ask for permissions. this feels fine as long as your prompt isn't bad.
>
> 2. start your setup from @steipete 's repo here - https://t.co/AYAlsng7d5 - i copied nearly all of it and obviously reworded parts that didn't relate to my work.
>
> 3. you have to use it differently than claude code so it'll take a couple of days to adjust. i found that if i give good instructions, it just one shots the task more reliably than CC. garbage in garbage out.
>
> 4. if you need a plan just write "make a plan" or use @thsottiaux 's skill here - https://t.co/ZFC1vhUVTk
>
> 5. codex is really good at long running tasks, especially when you give it a way to verify its outputs. the ralph-wiggum version for codex is typing "don't stop until …." and it'll listen.
>
> *Quoting @thsottiaux:* Simply adding "Ask questions if my request is underspecified" at the end of a prompt to Codex works well as you might expect, but also codified it a bit more in a `$ask-questions-if-underspecified` skill that I use regularly.

## @housecor - Claude Code: Slash Commands vs Skills
> Problem: In Claude Code, when should I create a custom slash command vs a skill?

## @the_smart_ape - Polymarket Bot Performance
> My @Polymarket bot is still running on my Raspberry Pi.
>
> 2 days ago: 26 trades triggered, 26 wins, 0 losses
> Now: 42 trades triggered, 42 wins, 0 losses
>
> I could change the parameters to increase the number of triggered orders, but that would make it less conservative.
>
> At these settings, I believe the bot can never lose, and each trigger guarantees ~1.5%. I could aim for more, but that would mean taking more risk.
>
> I prefer a guaranteed 1.5% per trade rather than higher returns with any chance of loss.
>
> I'll keep the bot running until it reaches 200 triggered orders before scaling it with much more capital.
>
> In the meantime, I'm building an analysis tool for Polymarket, not a trading bot this time, but an analytics tool that doesn't exist yet and could be very useful.
> Will keep you posted!

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/the_smart_ape/status/2007743064874590689
- **What:** Update on Polymarket trading bot performance showing 42 wins with 0 losses, conservative strategy prioritizing guaranteed returns over higher risk.
