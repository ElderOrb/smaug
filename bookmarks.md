> Święta racja, @ElonMusk! To jest sedno! Jak może Unia Europejska narzucać mojemu krajowi, Polsce, jak ma żyć, co ma robić i jakie standardy stosować? Od tego mam swojego Prezydenta i własny Rząd! Bycie w UE nie oznacza, że Komisja może być ponad moją Konstytucją i wolą narodu. To jest uzurpacja władzy i kompletny brak demokracji! Wstrzymywanie funduszy to SZANTAŻ i stosowanie podwójnych standardów. My, jako Lud, powinniśmy decydować o tym, kto zasiądzie w Europie! Pełna zgoda 🇵🇱

## @Argona0x - Polymarket Trading Strategies
> programmers are making $10k-200k monthly on polymarket
>
> here's how they actually do it
>
> ///
>
> 1. arbitrage bots
>
> buy YES + NO when combined price < $1
>
> example: YES at 48¢ + NO at 49¢ = 97¢ total
> you lock $0.03 profit per $1 no matter who wins
>
> trader "distinct-baguette" made $242k in 1.5 months doing this
>
> targets 15-min crypto markets where prices move fast
>
> python script polls API every 1-3 seconds, executes when sum < 99¢
>
> ///
>
> 2. statistical arbitrage
>
> find correlated markets that drift apart
>
> "trump wins" vs "GOP senate control" should move together
> when spread hits 4-7%, short expensive one, long cheap one
> close when they converge
>
> trader "sharky6999" made $480k scanning 100+ markets per minute
>
> ///
>
> 3. AI probability models
>
> train ML models to estimate real odds from news/social data
>
> if your model says 60% YES but market at 50¢, buy
>
> trader "ilovecircle" made $2.2M in 2 months with 74% accuracy
> uses ensemble of 10 AI models, retrains weekly
>
> ///
>
> 4. spread farming
>
> buy at bid (5¢), sell at ask (6¢), repeat
>
> or hedge across platforms (short polymarket, long binance)
>
> trader "cry.eth2" made $194k with 1M trades
>
> ///
>
> 5. copy-trading automation
>
> mirror successful whale traders automatically
>
> scan profiles, execute proportional trades
>
> one bot made $80k in 2 weeks copying near-resolved markets
>
> ///
>
> tech stack:
>
> python + requests library for API calls
>
> web3-py for blockchain interactions deploy on VPS for 24/7 operation
>
> polymarket has REST APIs for everything:
>
> gamma markets API (prices/volumes)
> CLOB API (place orders)
> data API (track positions)
>
> ///
>

## @the_smart_ape - Polymarket Bot Performance Update
> My @Polymarket bot is still running on my Raspberry Pi.
>
> 2 days ago: 26 trades triggered, 26 wins, 0 losses
> Now: 42 trades triggered, 42 wins, 0 losses
>
> I could change the parameters to increase the number of triggered orders, but that would make it less conservative.
>
> At these settings, I believe the bot can never lose, and each trigger guarantees ~1.5%. I could aim for more, but that would mean taking more risk.
>
> I prefer a guaranteed 1.5% per trade rather than higher returns with any chance of loss.
>
> I'll keep the bot running until it reaches 200 triggered orders before scaling it with much more capital.
>
> In the meantime, I'm building an analysis tool for Polymarket, not a trading bot this time, but an analytics tool that doesn't exist yet and could be very useful.
> Will keep you posted!
