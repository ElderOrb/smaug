## Overview
An AI session is a Turing-complete computer. OpenProse is a programming language for it. Structure English into unambiguous control flow—the session is the runtime.

## Key Concepts
- **Turing-complete**: AI sessions can be treated as full computers
- **English as code**: Structure natural language into unambiguous control flow
- **Session as runtime**: The AI session itself is the execution environment
