Fast, powerful, git-native ticket tracking system in a single bash script. Designed as a full replacement for Beads without the need for SQLite sync or background daemons. Tickets are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.tickets/` directory, making them easily searchable by AI agents.

## Key Features

- **Git-Native**: Stores tickets as markdown files, enabling version control and IDE navigation
- **Dependency Graphs**: Support for complex issue dependencies and querying
- **Zero Setup**: Single portable bash script requiring only coreutils (works on any POSIX system)
- **AI-Friendly**: Markdown format with YAML frontmatter makes tickets easy for AI agents to parse and search
- **Beads Migration**: Includes `migrate-beads` command for smooth transition from Beads
- **Priority Levels**: Built-in priority management for task organization
