A revolutionary concept: **An AI session is a Turing-complete computer. OpenProse is a programming language for it.**

## What Is OpenProse?

OpenProse treats AI coding sessions (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, Codex) as a new kind of computer - one that processes natural language instructions and executes code through AI agents.

Rather than writing Python/JavaScript directly, you write **structured English** that the AI interprets as commands. The "session" is the runtime, just like a physical computer has a CPU.

## Key Features

- **English-based programming**: Structure natural language into unambiguous control flow
- **Session-as-runtime**: The AI session itself is the computer
- **Cross-platform**: Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, and Codex
- **No dependencies**: Skill is a single markdown file - no code installation needed
- **Built-in onboarding**: Guides you through setup after installing the skill

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install the skill (no code, no dependencies)
# For Claude Code: Place in ~/.claude/skills/openprose.md

# 2. Restart Claude to load the skill

# 3. Initialize the "VM"
openprose boot
```

## Use Cases

- **Session orchestration**: Define multi-step workflows in English
- **Agent coordination**: Direct multiple AI agents in sequence
- **Project patterns**: Encode reusable workflows that can be invoked later
- **Knowledge base**: Build libraries of session commands for quick recall

## Why It Matters

Traditional coding requires:
- Learning syntax rules
- Managing dependencies
- Setting up build systems
- Debugging compilation errors

OpenProse eliminates all of this by leveraging the AI's understanding of natural language as a command interpreter.
