Tool that enables Claude Code's multi-agent orchestration feature by creating isolated Claude Code variants that connect to different AI providers. Each variant has its own config, sessions, themes, and API credentials — completely separate from each other.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Provider Support**: Z.ai (GLM-4.7), MiniMax (M2.1), OpenRouter (100+ LLMs), CCRouter (local LLMs), and Mirror Claude
- **Complete Isolation**: Each variant lives in its own directory with independent configuration
- **Quick Setup**: Interactive TUI and CLI quick-start commands
- **Custom Themes**: Built-in theme customization via TweakCC
- **Enhanced Prompts**: Improved prompt engineering for better results
